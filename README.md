#Pariksha Exam Portal

## Your go to portal to write and create Exams!
In the current times of a Global Pandemic, learning and student assessment have been heavily hampered. This
 creates a need for better online learning and assessment systems.
 This application aims to combat this problem that has been hindering the quality of education for students and ease
  of teaching for Instructors for the better part of this year.
  
  I would like introduce **Pariksha Exam Portal** *(Pariksha means Assessment in Hindi)*.
  This is an Exam Portal created to ease the process of taking tests for Students and the Instructors.

The functionality of this application includes:
- Sign Up for an account as a Student or Instructor.
- Login to an account as a Student or Instructor.
- As an Instructor, he/she can create new exams for students to attempt, as well as he/she can view exams created by
 other instructors. These exams will also be saved in a file.
- As a Student, he/she can view exams created by all instructors and then attempt these exams with the grade shown at
 the end.
- As a Student/Instructor the login credentials can be saved into a file.


This application can be used by all those students who are studying remotely and are trying to keep up with their
 coursework. As well as, Instructors who are working tirelessly from home to provide the best education experience
  possible at this moment in time.
